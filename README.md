# LiveStockProject
A stock project that is run in the terminal


 It utilized a free API that I found on the internet. This API only requires the stock symbol to work. This is merely for simulation for how the stock market works

 It starts you off with a set amount of money in the account.
 When you do any interactions they save to a history text file
 Your "Stock Account" and your "Bank Account" also save on your machine.

 To use the program you have to run the Runner.java file which is a child of "com.java.stock.stockproject" and the child of "src/main/java"
